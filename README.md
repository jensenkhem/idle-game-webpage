# idle-miner
# This is a little idle game I made for fun during quarantine!
# Start off mining copper, and work your way up in levels and tools! 
# 
# Commands (For input interface):
#   craft [pickname] | [item name [num]]
#   enchant
#   reset (NOTE: Only type if you want to RESET the game completely. You have been warned!)
# 
# Picknames:
#   cpick: (Copper pickaxe, costs 50 copper to attempt to craft - Power range 6 -> 10)
#   ipick: (Iron pickaxe, costs 75 iron to attempt to craft - Power range 15 -> 30)
#   spick: (Steel pickaxe, costs 50 steel to attempt to craft - Power range 50 -> 100)
#   mpick: (Mithril Pickaxe, costs 50 mithril to attempt to craft - Power range 125 -> 200) 
# 
# Items:
#   steel: Costs 5 iron and 8 copper to make!
# 
# Enchanting:
#   Enchanting costs 5 magical shards each! -> Enchantment cannot fail, but CAN downgrade
#   Magical shards are gained randomly at a small chance each successful mine!
#   As of now, enchantments increase mining speed multiplicatively!
#   NOTE: Enchantments are pickaxe-bound, and therefore disappear upon crafting a new pick!
